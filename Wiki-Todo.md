Need to update, validate, and expand the wiki.

To-do List:
* [ ] Check for consistency with the name "cnc", "cnc-js", "cncJS", "CNCjs". Needs to be just "cncjs"
* [ ] There is a broken link in the Docker section.  Do we want to mention docker at all?  How easy (or hard) is it to keep docker images up to date?
* [ ] Features List 
* * [ ] Explanation on Watch Directory's and what they do. 
* [  ] Explanation of Configuration Options.
* * [NOTE](https://github.com/cncjs/cncjs/issues/242#issuecomment-352294549)
* [ ] Change wiki pages to conform to the new naming "cncjs-server" etc.
* [ ] Draw some pictures showing different scenarios - desktop app, server and client on same computer, server and client(s) separate


Documentation Issues
* Need a quick start guide for developers.  There is a rudimentary development page with some tips, but it needs to be filled out and made comprehensive
* Explain what node.js and npm are, for the benefit of non-programmers
* https://github.com/cncjs/cncjs/wiki/Installation says "npm run prepublish" in two places.  There is no prepublish target in the top-level package.json
