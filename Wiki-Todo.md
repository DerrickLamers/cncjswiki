Need to update, validate, and expand the wiki.

To-do List:
* [ ] Check for consistantcy with the name "cnc", "cnc-js", "cncJS", "CNCjs". Needs to be just "cncjs"
* [ ] There is a broken link in the Docker section.
* [ ] Consider naming the server node "app" component to "cncjs-server" to distinguish it from the "all-in-one" Electron app?

Documentation Issues
* Need a quick start guide for developers
