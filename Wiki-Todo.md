Need to update, validate, and expand the wiki.

To-do List:
* [ ] Check for consistantcy with the name "cnc", "cnc-js", "cncJS", "CNCjs". Needs to be just "cncjs"
* [ ] There is a broken link in the Docker section.
* [ ] Consider naming the server node "app" component to "cncjs-server" to distinguish it from the "all-in-one" Electron app?
* [ ] Draw some pictures showing different scenarios - desktop app, server and client on same computer, server and client(s) separate

Documentation Issues
* Need a quick start guide for developers 
* Explain what node.js and npm are, for the benefit of non-programmers
