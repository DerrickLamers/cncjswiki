If you see the warning, you can go to the Security & Privacy pane of <b>System Preferences</b>, where you will see a message under the Gatekeeper settings about the recently blocked program. Click unlock in Security & Privacy pane and select "Allow apps downloaded from: Anywhere", then you will be able to continue program execution.
After that, you can restore the setting to default. Gatekeeper won't show you the warning again.
