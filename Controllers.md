### Branches
* MASTER is the current production code. This is not updated very frequently.
* EDGE branches are work-in-process for the next Master releases. Depending on the velocity of changes they will be somewhere between alpha and beta. An attempt is made to keep everything working and usable, but there are no guarantees for edge branches. Generally speaking, edge branches should not be used for production uses - use the master branch instead.
* Edge-0.97 is designed to be (mostly) backwards compatible with Master 440.xx. Changes are new features and additions that do not break current processing. However, there are a few changes that affect communication and other behaviors. These are listed below as Changes Affecting Migration from Master 440.xx to Edge-0.97.
* Edge-0.98 ports-in functionality available in the g2 code base. There are many changes that affect migration from Master 440.xx or edge-0.98. Please refer the the edge-0.98 readme or wiki for details.
