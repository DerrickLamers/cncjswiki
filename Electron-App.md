#### Important Notice

So far the macOS app is signed by a non-Apple issued Code Signing certificate, if you have Gatekeeper enabled on your Mac, a warning message will appear, informing you that the app can't be opened because it is from an unidentified developer.

#### View the app security settings on your Mac

If you see the warning, you can go to the Security & Privacy pane of System Preferences, where you will see a message under the Gatekeeper settings about the recently blocked program. Click unlock in Security & Privacy pane and select "Allow apps downloaded from: Anywhere", then you will be able to continue program execution.
After that, you can restore the setting to default. Gatekeeper won't show you the warning again.

#### Add an exception to your security settings

If you're certain that an app you want to install is from a trustworthy source and hasnâ€™t been tampered with, you can also temporarily override your Mac security settings and open it.

In the Finder, Control-click the app, choose Open from the menu, and in the dialog that appears, click Open. Enter your admin name and password when prompted.

The app is now saved as an exception to your security settings, and you can open it in the future by double-clicking it.
